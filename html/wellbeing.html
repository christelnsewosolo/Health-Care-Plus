    <h1>Covid Symptoms</h1>
    <p>Self-isolate if you or anyone in your household has symptoms. You can check your symptoms at NHS 111 online. This means you should not leave home if you or someone you live with has either:
      a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
      a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
      a change in your normal sense of taste or smell (known as anosmia)</p><br>
    <p>You should go for a test immediately. The only time you should leave the house is to go for a test. Tests can be booked online at<a href="https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/">NHS Helpline</a>or by calling 119. Do not go to GP surgery, pharmacy, walk-in centre or hospital if you think you might have coronavirus. Stay at home.
      If you start to have symptoms, you must get tested and the rest of your household should self-isolate with you whilst you wait for the results.

    <h2>Mental wellbeing while staying at home</h2>
    <p>Taking care of your mind as well as your body is really important if you are staying at home because of coronavirus (COVID-19).
      You may feel worried or anxious about your finances, your health or those close to you. Perhaps you feel bored, frustrated or lonely. 
      It's important to remember that it's OK to feel this way and that everyone reacts differently.</p><br>
    <p> Remember, for most of us, these feelings will pass. Staying at home may be difficult, but you're helping to protect yourself and others by doing it.
      There are things you can do now to help you keep on top of your mental wellbeing and cope with how you may feel if you're staying at home. 
      Make sure you get further support if you feel you need it.
